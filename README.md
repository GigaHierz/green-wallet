## Deploying smart&sustainable contracts

1. Get some tokens to pay the gas fees for deploying the smart contracts:
   1. Ethereum Goerli: https://goerlifaucet.com

```bash
cp example.env .env
touch .privatekey
# put environment variables in .env and .privatekey
source.env
npx hardhat deploy --chain-id 5
```

1. Deploy the smart contract: `npx hardhat deploy --chain-id [chainId]`
   1. If you want to deploy just the NFT or the Market without deploying everything run:
      1. `npx hardhat deploy:nft --chain-id [chainId]`
      1. `npx hardhat deploy:market --chain-id [chainId]`
   1. Here are some examples:
      1. Ethereum Goerli: `npx hardhat deploy --chain-id 5`

### Verifying tha magic Smart Contract on Etherscan

## Green wallet details

**GreenWallet** is a chain-agnostic DeFi app that simplifies eco-friendliness by automating carbon offsets for blockchain transactions.
GreenWallet aims to give the environmentally aware user a clean consciousness while browsing web3.
While the user has a seamless experience, GreenWallets mechanisms track all the transactions across chains and calculate the according carbon footprint.
We are specifically targeting a tech-savvy audience that cares about their environmental impact. While some web3 experience is necessary to use GreenWallet, we aim at an user-friendly and simple Inetrface.
Users can maximize their agency over their carbon impact by inspecting  analytics of their wallet transactions. These will give them visually digested information about the when, where and how of their carbon footprint creation. Our app is designed to offset the carbon emissions of transactions at regular intervals, ensuring that the environmental impact is consistently minimized over time.

Pitch:
We are building an eco-friendly wallet that automatically offsets your carbon footprint cross-chain by tracking your wallet activity. Aiming to provide a seamless opportunity for environmentally conscious users to improve their social impact.


```bash
source .env
node server/CreateNFT.js 'server/nfts.json'
